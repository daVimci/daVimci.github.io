Given a light source passes through a hole on the opaque screen, we can observe the \u0026ldquo;interference pattern\u0026rdquo;, which is involved in the diffraction of the light, on the viewing screen easily. To describe the diffraction of light, it can be regarded as any deviation from the geometric optics, that resulting from the obstruction of a wavefront of light.\nAccording to the Huygens-Fresnel principle, which pointed out that every point of a given wavefront of light can be considered as a source of secondary spherical wavelet. Thus, at some point on the viewing screen, every point emerges from a hole on the opaque screen, which the light pass through, as an array of source of wavelets whose superposition produces the resultant filed. As we mention an array of light source pass through a hole, we should note that diffraction is distinguished from the interference on this basis. In the diffraction phenomena, the interfering beams originate from a continuous distribution of beams; in interference phenomena, the interfering beams originate from a discrete number of sources. Thence, we will found that the pattern produced by the diffraction is different from the pattern produced by the interference[1].\nFor the interference pattern, it\u0026rsquo;s created by the superposition of the two or more individual coherent beam of the light which follows as the sine function form. However, for the diffraction pattern, it\u0026rsquo;s created by continuous light sources whose pattern follows as the sinc function. Diffraction from a single slit # In this section, I will give an explicit derivation of the diffraction pattern produced by a single slit. The light source is assumed to be monochromatic, and the slit is assumed to be infinitely long in the y-direction and of width \\(a\\) in the x-direction. The light source is assumed to be at a distance \\(D\\) from the slit, and the viewing screen is at a distance \\(L\\) from the slit. The coordinate system is shown in the figure below.\nTo Be Continued\u0026hellip;\nReference # [1] F. L. Pedrotti, L. M. Pedrotti, and L. S. Pedrotti, Introduction to Optics, 3rd ed.

The name of BB84 originates from the prefix-alphabet of the name of these two scientists, “B” to “Bennett” and “Barassard”, “84” from the year of the paper is proposed.\nDr. Charles H. Bennett, who is known for quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography and was awarded the breakthrough prize in fundamental science in 2023. Gilles Grassard, who is known for quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation and also was awarded the breakthrough prize in fundamental science in 2023. This protocol is designed for the one-time pad (OTP) encryption technique. Based on the no-clone theorem and superposition property of the quantum states, we can avoid any disturbance from stealing any information during the process of private key communication. That is the reason why that it relies on two condition (a) there should exist the authenticated classical channel to verify the properties from the private key communication, and (b) it requires that the information gain is only possible when disturbing basis is not orthogonal to information.\nOne-Time Pad Encryption # In cryptography, there are two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Suppose Alice want to send the message to Bob by encryption. She can encrypt the message by a sequence of operations to encode it into scrambled characteristics (ciphertext), then send it to Bob. For the symmetric encryption, it means that if Bob would like to decode the ciphertext, he should perform the same operations which is so-called the “key” on them. However, for asymmetric encryption, the keys are different from Alice and Bob.\nSecurity # The security of this one-time pad encryption had been proved by Claude Shannon in 1949. If the following conditions are met, it’s hard to decode the ciphertext:\nThe key must be long as the message (plaintext). The key should be generated randomly from chaotic and uncertain source The key only be used once and should be destroyed after communication. The key should be kept completely secret. Example # Suppose Alice want to send the message “Hello” to Bob. First, she can encode these words into the binary expression which can be shown as:\n01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 --palintext Use the random generated ciphertext which both sides agree with to encrypt the message:\n00101011 01100101 01110100 00110110 00011110 --private key Then, Alice can apply the “XOR” operation on these two binary sequences that she obtains:\n01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 XOR 00101011 01100101 01110100 00110110 00011110 ---------------------------------------------------- 01100011 00000000 00011000 01011010 01110001 --ciphertext Finally, Alice can send ciphertext to Bob without any concern. Even though eavesdropper retrieve the message during the communication, but he still can’t decode this ciphertext without the private key. That’s why Alice and Bob should keep the key completely secret to prevent eavesdropper decoding the message. As Bob receiving the message, he just performs the same operation on the ciphertext then he can get the correct information from Alice.\nDescription # Image illustrates the BB84 protocol[1].
