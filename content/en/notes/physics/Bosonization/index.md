In the high-density limit of a one-dimensional electron system, the ground state is no longer a simple filled Fermi sea; instead, it incorporates collective modes that arise once the two-body interaction is switched on. This system had studied by Haldane which is so called Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid[1].

Landau developed the Fermi-liquid theory [2] to describe interacting electron systems at low temperatures in higher dimensions. In this framework, the low-lying eigenstates evolve continuously from those of the non-interacting system when interactions are adiabatically switched on. In other words, Fermi-liquid theory treats electrons near the Fermi surface as weakly perturbed quasiparticles. However, this picture breaks down because interactions are inherently strong in one-dimension. Instead, the system can be reformulated in terms of an effective free description of collective excitations, a technique known as bosonization.
