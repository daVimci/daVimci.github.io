Hello, I'm the master student at NTHU physics who is studying the theoretical physics. My recent search is on the non-Hermitian physics which can described the open quantum system effectively. I'm interested on topological property on toplogicla system with non-Hermicity which is defferent from the conventional topological system. In order to dicuss that what's happened to physics observables with dissapation. I'm also interested on superconductor and graphene physics.
