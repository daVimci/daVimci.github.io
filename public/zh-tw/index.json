We will expect that the charged particles are accelerated within this strong field region undergoing the scatter process when the applied voltage is high enough. Charged particles possess high energy that can collide to other bonded particles, to transfer excess energy to knock it into the conducting or valence band to create the electron-hole pair. This a serial of chain reaction can happen so that leads to the carrier multiplication and the avalanche breakdown. This scattering phenomenon is so-called impact ionization which can generate more carriers and amplify the current in the device.\nMoving electron collides the bonded particle to create the eletron-hole pair[1]. Ionization Rate and Ionization Integral # As we quantifying the impact ionization of the system, ionization rate should be introduced which can be defined as the number of the carrier is generated per unit distance within two collide, which can be expressed as[2]:\n$$ \\alpha_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{dn}{d(tv_n)} = \\frac{1}{nv_t}\\frac{dn}{dt} $$\nAccounting for the creation of the electron-hole pair, the creation of the number of hole during the collision is same as electron ones as:\n$$ G^{II} = \\frac{dn}{dt} =\\frac{dp}{dt}= nv_n \\alpha_n = pv_p\\alpha_p $$\nDuring the impact ionization process, we can analyze variance of the current density flow from the one end of the depletion region to the another. Then, we define \\(M\\) the multiplication factor to describe the change of the current density. First, let\u0026rsquo;s define the total current in the steady state as follows: $$ J=J_n + J_p $$\nwhich should be constant value along the device. Thence, assume the width of depletion region is \\(W\\), the current density at the one end of position \\(x=0, J_p(0)=J_{p0}\\). Consider the impact ionization process occurs within the depletion region, the current density at x=W should be $$ J_p(W)=J_{p0}M_p=J. $$\nFor the change of the current density \\(J_p\\) during the collision which can be evaluated as $$ dJ_p = J_p \\alpha_pdx+J_n\\alpha_ndx $$ which can reformulate as the first order differential equation[2] $$ \\frac{dJ_p}{dx}= J_p\\alpha_p+(J-J_p)\\alpha_n. $$\nWe can turn this differential equation into a general form as $$ y\u0026rsquo; + Py = Q $$ where \\(P = (\\alpha_p -\\alpha_n)\\) and \\(Q = \\alpha J\\). The homogeneous solution can be obtained easily as $$ y_h = C \\exp(-\\int^x_0 P dx\u0026rsquo;) $$ where C is the integral constant. For the inhomogeneous one, we can differentiate the homogeneous one first, $$ y\u0026rsquo;_p = C\u0026rsquo; \\exp(-\\int^x_0 Pdx\u0026rsquo;) - P y_p. $$ Then, we put it into our equation that we have $$ Q = C\u0026rsquo; \\exp(-\\int^x_p P dx) \\Rightarrow C = \\int^x_0 Q \\exp(\\int^{x\u0026rsquo;}_p P dx\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;) dx\u0026rsquo;. $$ Therefore, the inhomogeneous solution can be expressed as $$ y_p = \\exp(-\\int^x_0Pdx\u0026rsquo;) [\\int^x_0 Q \\exp(\\int^{x\u0026rsquo;}_0Pdx\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;)dx]. $$\nFinally, the general solution is obtained as $$ y = y_h+y_p=\\exp(-\\int^x_o P dx\u0026rsquo; ) [\\int^x_0 Q \\exp (\\int^{x\u0026rsquo;}_0 P dx\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;)dx\u0026rsquo; + C]. $$\nApplying the boundary condition, \\(J_p(0) = J_{p0} \\) and \\( J_p(W) = J = M_p J_{p0} \\), the current density has the forms as\n$$ J_{p}(x) = J \\exp(-\\int^x_0 (\\alpha_p - \\alpha_n) dx\u0026rsquo;) [\\int^x_0 \\alpha_n \\exp( \\int^{x\u0026rsquo;}_0 -(\\alpha_p - \\alpha_n) dx\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;) dx\u0026rsquo; +\\frac{1}{M_p} ]. $$\nTo simplified the solution above, we consider the current density \\(J_p(W) = J\\) and use the integration by part for the integral on the exponential which refers to $$ \\int^W_0 (\\alpha_p - \\alpha_n) \\exp(\\int^{x\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;}_0 -(\\alpha_p - \\alpha_n) dx\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;) dx\u0026rsquo; = -\\exp(\\int^W_0 -(\\alpha_p - \\alpha_n ) dx\u0026rsquo;) + 1. $$ The final becomes as $$ 1 = \\int^W_0 \\alpha_p \\exp(-\\int^x_0 (\\alpha_p-\\alpha_n)dx\u0026rsquo;)dx \\Rightarrow 1 = \\int^W_0 \\alpha dx $$ where \\(M_p \\rightarrow \\infty \\) when avalanche occurs and assumes that \\(\\alpha = \\alpha_p = \\alpha_n\\). The integral is so called the ionization integral, here, we should notice that once we know the form of the ionization rate \\(\\alpha\\) as function of electric field, we can easily derive the breakdown voltage from the ionization integral.\nReferences # [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_ionization\n[2] https://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/triebl/node20.html\n","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/notes/physics/ionization_rate_and_integral/","section":"Notes","summary":"","title":"⚡ Impact Ionization Rate and Ionization Integral","type":"notes"},{"content":"","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/bsim-model/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"BSIM Model","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/semiconductor-physics/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Semiconductor Physics","type":"categories"},{"content":" ","date":"21 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-tw/","section":"The Blog","summary":"","title":"The Blog","type":"page"},{"content":"\n我是嘉緯，目前任職於力晶積成電子製造股份有限公司（PSMC)， 職位是SPICE模型工程師。我的工作主要是開發和維護SPICE模型，其用於模擬和分析半導體器件的電氣特性，參與過的元件包括MOSFET、BJT、二極體及其他的半導體元件。主要的專業在於透過分析元件內部的各種物理特性建構相對應的SPICE model card，並保持在模擬時能反應真實元件的固有性質。另外，我擁有國立清華大學物理學碩士學位，專攻凝態物理，並在國立彰化師範大學完成了我的學士學位。我的研究興趣包括半導體物理、凝態物理以及數值模擬技術。 工作經歷 # \u0026#8226; 力晶積成電子製造股份有限公司 \u0026#160;\u0026#160;(PSMC) 2024/05-目前 個人學歷 # \u0026#8226; 私立明道高級中學 (MDHS) 2013/09-2016/08 \u0026#x2022; 國立彰化師範大學 (NCUE) 2016/09-2020/08 \u0026#x2022; 國立清華大學 (NTHU) 2020/09-2023/07 教學經驗 # \u0026#8226; 普通物理 (大學主修課程) 2019/09-2020/06 \u0026#x2022; 物理數學 (大學主修課程) 2019/09-2020/06 程式語言技能 # Fortran (中等): 著重於數值模擬 Mathematica (中等): 用於符號運算 Latex (中等): 用於報告、論文的發表 Python (中等): 當有適合的函式庫用於模擬時會使用 C/C++ (初學): 為了好玩 個人履歷 # ","date":"21 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-tw/about/","section":"The Blog","summary":"","title":"關於我","type":"page"},{"content":" Introduction # The interference effect, produced by the superposition of the two or more individual coherent beam of the light, which is originated from the light can be explained by the wave character of light. Given a light source passes through a hole on the opaque screen, we can observe the \u0026ldquo;interference pattern\u0026rdquo;, which is involved in the diffraction of the light, on the viewing screen easily. To describe the diffraction of light, it can be regarded as any deviation from the geometric optics, that resulting from the obstruction of a wavefront of light.\nAccording to the Huygens-Fresnel principle, which pointed out that every point of a given wavefront of light can be considered as a source of secondary spherical wavelet. Thus, at some point on the viewing screen, every point emerges from a hole on the opaque screen, which the light pass through, as an array of source of wavelets whose superposition produces the resultant filed. As we mention an array of light source pass through a hole, we should note that diffraction is distinguished from the interference on this basis. In the diffraction phenomena, the interfering beams originate from a continuous distribution of beams; in interference phenomena, the interfering beams originate from a discrete number of sources. Thence, we will found that the pattern produced by the diffraction is different from the pattern produced by the interference[1].\nFor the interference pattern, it\u0026rsquo;s created by the superposition of the two or more individual coherent beam of the light which follows as the sine function form. However, for the diffraction pattern, it\u0026rsquo;s created by continuous light sources whose pattern follows as the sinc function. Diffraction from a single slit # In this section, I will give an explicit derivation of the diffraction pattern produced by a single slit. The light source is assumed to be monochromatic, and the slit is assumed to be infinitely long in the y-direction and of width \\(a\\) in the x-direction. The light source is assumed to be at a distance \\(D\\) from the slit, and the viewing screen is at a distance \\(L\\) from the slit. The coordinate system is shown in the figure below.\nTo Be Continued\u0026hellip;\nReference # [1] F. L. Pedrotti, L. M. Pedrotti, and L. S. Pedrotti, Introduction to Optics, 3rd ed.

The name of BB84 originates from the prefix-alphabet of the name of these two scientists, “B” to “Bennett” and “Barassard”, “84” from the year of the paper is proposed.\nDr. Charles H. Bennett, who is known for quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography and was awarded the breakthrough prize in fundamental science in 2023. Gilles Grassard, who is known for quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation and also was awarded the breakthrough prize in fundamental science in 2023. This protocol is designed for the one-time pad (OTP) encryption technique. Based on the no-clone theorem and superposition property of the quantum states, we can avoid any disturbance from stealing any information during the process of private key communication. That is the reason why that it relies on two condition (a) there should exist the authenticated classical channel to verify the properties from the private key communication, and (b) it requires that the information gain is only possible when disturbing basis is not orthogonal to information.\nOne-Time Pad Encryption # In cryptography, there are two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Suppose Alice want to send the message to Bob by encryption. She can encrypt the message by a sequence of operations to encode it into scrambled characteristics (ciphertext), then send it to Bob. For the symmetric encryption, it means that if Bob would like to decode the ciphertext, he should perform the same operations which is so-called the “key” on them. However, for asymmetric encryption, the keys are different from Alice and Bob.\nSecurity # The security of this one-time pad encryption had been proved by Claude Shannon in 1949. If the following conditions are met, it’s hard to decode the ciphertext:\nThe key must be long as the message (plaintext). The key should be generated randomly from chaotic and uncertain source The key only be used once and should be destroyed after communication. The key should be kept completely secret. Example # Suppose Alice want to send the message “Hello” to Bob. First, she can encode these words into the binary expression which can be shown as:\n01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 --palintext Use the random generated ciphertext which both sides agree with to encrypt the message:\n00101011 01100101 01110100 00110110 00011110 --private key Then, Alice can apply the “XOR” operation on these two binary sequences that she obtains:\n01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 XOR 00101011 01100101 01110100 00110110 00011110 ---------------------------------------------------- 01100011 00000000 00011000 01011010 01110001 --ciphertext Finally, Alice can send ciphertext to Bob without any concern. Even though eavesdropper retrieve the message during the communication, but he still can’t decode this ciphertext without the private key. That’s why Alice and Bob should keep the key completely secret to prevent eavesdropper decoding the message. As Bob receiving the message, he just performs the same operation on the ciphertext then he can get the correct information from Alice.\nDescription # Image illustrates the BB84 protocol[1].
